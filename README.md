# CA03 - Decision Tree
Lindsay Song, Valentin Gulyas, Andrea Lopez

# Description 
This notebook takes data from the Census Bureau and represents salaries of people along with seven demographic variables. We took this data and created training and test data to crate a decision tree algorithm to predict an indvidual's income. 

# Necessary Libraries 
The following libraries are required for this code to run properly:
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib.pyplot
* seaborn
* graphviz

# Data
We are using data from the Census Bureau and the path from the github link. Exact path: "https://github.com/ArinB/MSBA-CA-03-Decision-Trees/blob/master/census_data.csv?raw=true" 
We programmatically created our Training and Testing datasets as separate dataframes based on the column value.

# Acknowledgements

# How to Run 
Open the CA03_DecisionTreeLATEST.ipynb file in a text editor that can run Python 3.11.1
